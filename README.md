# Physiopsychology_stimuli

These are scripts written for presentation software Inquisit (v4).

There are 4 types of scripts (*iqx) for various labs and training setups. 

Participants are connected via phsyiology sensors and the presentation 
software shows various negative, neutral stimuli to the participant. 

We gather EMG, EDA, ECG, fMRI data simultaneously as the above presentaiton stimuli runs.
